    <h2>About The MSU Historical Photos Walking Tour App</h2>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.lib.montana.edu/archives/" target="_blank">Montana State University Archives</a> holds over 34,000 volumes and 1,200 linear feet of archive manuscript materials. In addition to the manuscript materials, there are also archived: microforms, sound recordings, film and video recordings, unique maps and historical photographs. Over 4,000 of these historical photographs are of Montana State University from 1893 through the 1960s. These unique MSU historical photos include: early 20th century campus student activities and clubs, campus grounds and buildings, historical events, and prominent alumnus, faculty and administrators.</p>
    <p>In 2012, the Montana State University Archives and the Montana State University Library Digital Initiatives launched the Montana State University (MSU) Historical Photographs Database Project. Phase 1 of the project included selecting historical photographs and scanning and tagging them for browser delivery through a searchable database.</p>
    <p>Phase 1 also included the development of the MSU Historic Photos Tour beta application. The App is designed to deliver selected digital historic photos associated with a map of MSU campus buildings for delivery in hand-held devices to users walking around the campus.</p>
    <p>Version 2 of the tour application was crafted as a Progressive Web App (PWA) by <a href="https://github.com/PeytonEllis">Peyton Ellis</a> and <a href="http://www.jasonclark.info">Jason A. Clark</a> sameAs <a href="https://twitter.com/jaclark">@jaclark</a>.</p>
    <p>The MSU Historical Photographs Database Project is an on-going, long-term project focused on providing Montana State University historical photographs online and in easily accessible downloadable jpg format.</p>
